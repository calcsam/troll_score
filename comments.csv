7,24,-17,"<i>we like our signal to noise ratio to be as high as possible around here</i><p>That may be true for select individuals, but I&#x27;ll posit that it&#x27;s no longer broadly true for the majority of the people on this site who vote.<p>Going by my own comments (since those are the only ones I can see the score counts for), and comments which are obviously mass-downvoted (grayed out), I see cases all the time where &quot;serious&quot; posts - which are well researched, features citations, links, and serious discussion - languish.  Meanwhile, the occasional angry rant directed at a popular &quot;bogeyman&quot; (like the NSA) gets massive upvotes.<p>Honestly, I feel like most of the talk about &quot;signal to noise&quot; ratio here is just a meme itself at this point.  Sure, the gratuitously silly stuff gets downvoted to oblivion,","<p>Looking at your comments, you seem to prefer a more direct and assertive style of debate than is normal on here. So do I, but I&#x27;ve chosen to adjust because I&#x27;ve found that a harsh tone signals aggression to people here where in other contexts it instead signals passion for the idea.</p><p>Or: I propose the hypothessis that your calibration for how other people are perceiving things is incorrect, and that if you adjust that, then while there&#x27;s still a lower percentage for whom it&#x27;s true than there used to be, on average people still value signal more than you do.</p>"

1,2,-1,- Base salary for fresh out of school engineer is about 40 kEUR<p>Are you talking about France?,"<p>Yes, in France out of one of the &quot;top&quot; schools, in Paris area. As yulaow mentions, it can be cheaper in other areas.</p>"
2,3,-1,"It&#x27;s absolutely possible, perhaps even likely. The point is, without any transparency, we don&#x27;t know. People have a fairly reliable tendency to assume the worst option - the simple cure for that is transparency.","<p>I&#x27;m gonna play the devil&#x27;s advocate here. Obscurity might actually be a good thing for this community.</p><p>&gt; <i>The point is, without any transparency, we don&#x27;t know.</i></p><p>But either way we are told to use flagging functionality, so we should continue doing it. Just because you or I, <i>think</i> that an article should be flagged and therefore taken off the site, doesn&#x27;t mean it should. We cast our vote and move on. I&#x27;m curious as to what your expectations are of the people on the site when more transparency is involved? That to me is the glaring question - how do we create an environment where the behavior of the community is consistently following the rules?</p><p>My increasing frustration with HN has nothing to do with the technology or the moderation, but more so about the other 20% of the people whose contribution adds zero value (whether that be they are upvoting terrible comments, submitting unrelated material, or not following guidelines). I believe you and I are in the same boat - we are extremely passionate about seeing HN succeed. Our environment dictates that if we continue to follow the guidelines and promoting the same values, the community will thrive. If everyone does this, then the community succeeds, regardless of whether moderation exists. Perhaps we should be focusing more on educating bad actors on why they shouldn&#x27;t act out of line, rather than question the good actors (mods) intentions?</p>"
21,22,-1,"So even though the US is allied to the state I am a citizen of, should I ever work for any sort of communications company, I&#x27;ll be fair game for US intelligence services.<p>Got it. For practical purposes, the alliance is worthless then.","<p>Though it seems states used to act more publicly ashamed of it, espionage has been a part of the interactions between states allied or not since the beginning of time.  Suggesting otherwise is incredibly naïve as is supposing military alliance with the United States is worthless.</p>"
14,15,-1,2.4ghz is heavily regulated in the US.  Did you mean public domain vs privately owned or something?,"<p>yeah, my comparison is a bit loose, I&#x27;m linking &quot;unlicensed&quot; and &quot;unregulated&quot; to each other.</p>"
15,16,-1,"On other forums, when you&#x27;ve been banned, you get an email or message telling you why and you no longer have access to that account. You also probably will have gotten a few warnings from moderators before that point.",<p>When the barrier to entry is 0 this is an ineffective strategy.  From my experiences moderating a fairly large geographic area forum negative influences on the community do and will just recreate a new account immediately and resume when you do that.  At least this way you delay that from happening for a while and force them to expel effort on nothing.</p>

0,0,0,"I think a bigger issue is that the front page is <i>too</i> important. It&#x27;s always going to be the page with the most views, but compared to most other aggregation sites, Hacker News has very little memory and makes access to the archives difficult.<p>This is part of what shapes its community, of course. There&#x27;s probably at least some reasoning behind why it works that way, but it seems to me that the lack of memory distorts the importance of the front page.",
0,0,0,"You know what I love about Tesla? They continue to innovate and create change in the auto industry, most of all as a company they are powered by transparency.<p>Similar to other luxury auto companies they facilitate innovation. While luxury car companies strive to create beautiful, seamless and future-forward vehicles at a high cost, they can afford (similar to startups) to bring in new ideas to not only rule out competition but give them a market advantage. \nFor example - recently McLaren came up with a way to introduce sound waves, instead of windshield wipers, wipers are a pain! (Not to say that the device generating the waves wouldn&#x27;t be) Can you imagine toyota, chrysler, or ford doing something of the sort? Of Course not - it takes probably 20 hours for them to build one of theirs, where it might take Rolls Royce 6-7 months. However there are different profit margins and reputable name sake.<p>I like to think Elon has engineered his company nicely in between :), he surely got pissed off by the media and had fun adding that ballistic plate to the bottom",

4,4,0,"&gt;AMD&#x27;s been making free drivers for seven years.<p>It takes lot of time and effort to get GPU drivers usable with all features. I would say they actually did a great job hiring OSS people, contributing documentation after lengthy legal reviews and they kept up with most older and newer GPUs. And they now have dynamic power management! That&#x27;s great progress for me.","<p>You&#x27;re fooling yourself if you don&#x27;t think they could&#x27;ve done better.  There&#x27;s no reason they had to start from scratch. Bridgman constantly stated the the free drivers were intended for basic functionality and free software development purposes only, and that AMD would continue to provide proprietary drivers for people who needed performance.</p><p>ATi started the free drivers in a last-ditch move of desperation to inflate sales in whatever small way possible when they were on the ropes. They&#x27;d hoped that this would get some of the *nix geeks to make significant buys. They only sponsored 2 developers if I remember right.</p><p>I don&#x27;t mean to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I don&#x27;t think they really deserve all that much credit. Seven years is far too long to start skirting Windows performance parity, and please note that most newer hardware is still way behind. The open-source AMD drivers primarily remain of interest to people who want to develop free software or whose cards stopped working on the proprietary drivers. When I tried last September, you still couldn&#x27;t reasonably play games with open-source radeon drivers on newish hardware.</p>"

2,2,0,"I&#x27;m honestly curious. Is a large portion of the Hacker News audience just less operationally experienced compared to the programming side of things? It seems like Linux 101 lists like this make it to the top of HN pretty regularly but I&#x27;d equate this to a post about Python that listed for&#x2F;while loops, if statements, how to create a class, etc. Am I blinded by my own experiences or do very basic Linux seem to do very well on this site.",<p>How long were you involved with Linux before you knew everything in that list?</p>

4,3,1,"I love this. Although it is a bit more advanced than what we had, we suffered a similar problem:<p>On Friday when the boss shouted us pizza, we had a problem with everybody trying to order various pizza&#x27;s, various half pizza&#x27;s, and various sized pizzas over email. Then the orderer had to collate all of these into a coherent order for the pizza shop.<p>In the end, we wrote a new module for our internal project management system called &quot;The Pizza Module&quot;.<p>The Pizza Module would be pre-populated with the menu of our favourite pizza shop, so that you couldn&#x27;t place an order for something that didn&#x27;t exist. It would then allow people to enter orders via intranet, and then resolve things like four people ordering &quot;half a mexicana&quot; into two mexicana&#x27;s. It also came with the &quot;fat graph&quot; report, which always had the orderer with the fattest amount (due to people who didn&#x27;t have access to the intranet ordering through him).<p>Finally, it was fitted with a feature that prevented ordering, unless your timesheet was complete for the past two months. For a long time, it was very successful, and worked perfectly as intended).<p>However, in the end, it broke down when we moved away from it as we shifted to a different project management system. Nobody could be bothered writing a new pizza module (or refactoring the old pizza module to work with various project management systems), so we now use a collaborative Google doc with a table that people can place orders in. This is a Bad Idea™, and is far more open to gaming than the system described in the article. However, it is good for 5 minutes of entertainment on a Friday morning, watching people going back and forth on the shared doc.",<p>Could you please elaborate on how people tried to game the system and what was done to try to mitigate that?</p>
2,1,1,"I couldn&#x27;t immediately tell from your reply whether you didn&#x27;t know about pushd&#x2F;popd or were mentioning them as something missing from the list. Since I don&#x27;t seem to see them in the posted list I&#x27;m going to assume the latter.<p>For anyone who is curious about pushd&#x2F;popd, pushd will change your current working directory and adds your new working directory to the top of a stack. popd will remove the top directory from the stack and change your current working directory to the new top of stack. This is helpful in scripts where you need to change directories for some action and then back out to where you were. You can also use the dirs command to list the stack.<p>One reason I could see omitting these from the list is that they are shell builtins rather than external commands as the vast majority of the list is.","<p>I use &quot;cd -&quot; all the time, it changes to the previous working directory</p>"
15,11,4,"I don&#x27;t think the problem lies in transparency. The problem is scaling the community. How to keep the signal high? Naturally, people are trying to organise things by adding rules when you simply cannot relay on &quot;level of trust&quot;. Sadly, there is a hidden cost with every regulation. For example, I stopped actively participating in StackOverflow. I pine the days when SO was a lot smaller community with high signal to noise ratio, but, more importantly, it had that human feel.<p>These days, it&#x27;s very different. Topic are being parsed and filtered by robotic moderator that cannot possibly let something even remotely option-based slip through. Comment that are relevant, but with subtle jokes are deleted. I remember when Joel and Jeff were actively answering questions to have the critical mass. Now that answers and questions would be closed or moderated. e.g. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/652788/what-is-the-worst-real-world-macros-pre-processor-abuse-youve-ever-come-across"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;652788&#x2F;what-is-the-worst-...</a>","<p>I agree, the main site seems to be 90% &quot;Write code for beginning programmers who are too lazy to do any research on their own.&quot;</p><p>However, the chatrooms are an excellent place to have those opinion-based off-topic discussions.  I find I&#x27;ve spent far more time idling away the hours in JS chat and learned far more.</p>"
6,0,6,"Is it possible that it sometimes doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with moderation at all?<p>Every submission has a big &#x27;flag&#x27; button on it.

Completely legal, even. A bunch of people complained:<p>&gt; Two angry parents went to her principal’s office to express their outrage, and one parent threatened to remove her child from school. The school also received at least a dozen irate phone calls. Twenty to 25 people gathered outside the school to protest because of the statements, and news reporters and camera crews from major news organizations descended upon the school. At the next Home-School Council meeting, the majority of the meeting was devoted to O’Brien’s posts and parents expressed their outrage over the posts. When O’Brien was made aware of the outrage against her posts, she was surprised that her posts had led to such a reaction.<p>Certainly those people disagree that your line exists where you think it does, because they <i>do</i> believe that the teacher&#x27;s private actions certainly are relevant.<p>BTW, this is not bullying.
